    "Artificial Intelligence is about executing machine learning algorithms on products that we use every day. Any ML algorithm, for it to be effective, needs the following prerequisite steps to be done.\n",
    "- `Data Collection` – Conducting opinion Surveys, scraping the internet, etc.\n",
    "- `Data Handling` – Viewing data as a table, performing cleaning activities like checking for spellings, removal of blanks and wrong cases, removal of invalid values from data, etc.\n",
    "- `Data Visualization` – plotting appealing graphs, so anyone who looks at the data can know what story the data tells us.\n",
    "- `Pandas` – short for `Panel Data` (A panel is a 3D container of data) – is a library in python which contains in-built functions to clean, transform, manipulate, visualize and analyze data."
