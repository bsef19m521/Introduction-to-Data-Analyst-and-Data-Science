The Grammar of Graphics refers to the mapping of data to aesthetic attributes (colour, shape, size) and geometric objects (points, lines, bars). The basic building blocks according to the grammar of graphics are data, geom (geometric objects), stats (statistical transformations), scale, coordinate system, and facet.\n",
    "- Using ggplot in Python allows you to develop informative visualizations incrementally, understanding the nuances of the data first, and then tuning the components to improve the visual representations."
